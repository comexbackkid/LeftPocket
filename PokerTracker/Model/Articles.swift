Many poker players pride themselves on grinding long sessions, sometimes through the night. But pushing your body and mind past the point of exhaustion doesn’t win you more pots – it just quietly erodes your edge.

As Dr. Patricia Cardner and Jonathan Little write in Positive Poker, “With enough sleep deprivation, both judgement and performance will decline.” That drop-off is subtle at first, but dangerous. Even mild sleep loss reduces your willpower, increases emotional reactivity, and makes it harder to resist tilt, distractions, or poor decisions.

Sleep is where your brain resets and restores higher-level thinking. It’s when the prefrontal cortex – the part of your brain responsible for focus, planning, and emotional regulation – recovers its strength. Without enough rest, it can’t properly manage the amygdala, your brain’s fight-or-flight center. That imbalance can cause you to misread situations, take unnecessary risks, or lose patience at critical moments.

If you’re serious about improving your game, protecting your sleep is one of the most underrated strategies available. The best decisions at the table come from a sharp, focused mind—and that starts with how well you sleep away from it.
